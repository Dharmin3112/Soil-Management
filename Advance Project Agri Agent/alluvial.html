            <p class="info">Alluvium (from Latin alluvius, from alluere 'to wash against') is loose clay, silt, sand, or
                gravel that has been
                deposited by running water in a stream bed, on a floodplain, in an alluvial fan or beach, or in similar
                settings.Alluvium is also sometimes called alluvial deposit.Alluvium is typically geologically young
                and is not consolidated into solid rock. Sediments deposited underwater, in seas, estuaries, lakes, or
                ponds, are not
                described as alluvium. Floodplain alluvium can be highly fertile, and supported some of the earliest
                human
                civilizations.</p>

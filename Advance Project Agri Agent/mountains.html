            <p class="info">Mountain ecosystems are unique due to their varied climates and altitudes. As you go higher,
                the temperature drops and
                the environment changes, creating different habitats. These ecosystems are home to a diverse range of
                plants and
                animals, many of which are specially adapted to the harsh conditions
                Forest soils in mountainous regions develop more slowly compared to other areas.

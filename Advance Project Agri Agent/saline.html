            <p class="info">Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (greater than 8.5), a poor soil
                structure and a low infiltration
                capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their
                unfavorable
                physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil
                to swell[1] and
                difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which
                sodium belongs,
                and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils.
                Alkaline soils are
                basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline.</p>

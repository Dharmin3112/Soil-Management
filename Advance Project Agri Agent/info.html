      <p class="info">Red soil is a type of soil that typically develops in warm, temperate, and humid climates and
        comprises approximately
        13% of Earth's soils.[1] It contains thin organic and organic-mineral layers of highly leached soil resting on a
        red
        layer of alluvium. Red soils contain large amounts of clay and are generally derived from the weathering of
        ancient
        crystalline and metamorphic rock. They are named after their rich red color, varying from reddish brown to
        reddish
        yellow due to their high iron content.[2] Red soil can be good or poor growing soil depending on how it is
        managed. It
        is usually low in nutrients and humus and can be difficult to cultivate due to its low water holding capacity;
        however,
        the fertility of these soils can be optimized with liming and other farming techniques.[1]</p>

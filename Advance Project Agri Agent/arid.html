            <p class="info">Deserts and xeric shrublands are a biome defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature. Deserts
                and xeric shrublands form the largest terrestrial biome, covering 19% of Earth's land surface area.
                Ecoregions in this habitat type vary greatly in the amount of annual rainfall they receive, usually less
                than 250
                millimetres (10 in) annually except in the margins. Generally evaporation exceeds rainfall in these
                ecoregions.
                Temperature variability is also diverse in these lands. Many deserts, such as the Sahara, are hot
                year-round, but
                others, such as East Asia's Gobi, become quite cold during the winter.</p>
